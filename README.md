- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While making this project i learned a lot of things like "CSS Grid" and "Flexbox" and also learned about "Media Query Breakpoints" . I also learned about "Bootstrap" and how to use it. I also learned about "CSS Variables" and how to use it. I also learned about "CSS Pseudo-elements" and how to use it.

Some code snippet for fun ðŸ˜€:

```html
<h1>Host your website with Loruki</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: hostwithLoruki;
}
```
```js
const learning = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

I want to learn more about "CSS Grid" and "Bootstrap" and also want to learn more about "Media Query Breakpoints" .
